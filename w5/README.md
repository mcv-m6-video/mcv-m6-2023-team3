## Week 5

During this week we are goint to follow with the Multi-object Single camara tracking and the additonal of Multi-object Multi-camara tracking challenge.
The proble will be faced on the [AICity Challenge 2020](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/): **City-Scale Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking.**
The goal is to track vehicles across multiple cameras arround a city. 

We have proposed the following solution for each task
* **Multi-target single-camera (MTSC) tracking**
    * Tracking from detections in  Maske R-CNN, SSD512 and Yolo3 backbones.
    * Create a solution based on tracking by overlap and Kalman tracker.
    * Remove static cars based on the distance traveled along the video

* **Multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking**
