# Wee2

During the second week of the project, we focused on exploring various image processing techniques and evaluating their effectiveness. We worked on tasks such as Gaussian modeling and recursive Gaussian modeling to improve the quality of the image sequences. Additionally, we evaluated the results and compared them to non-recursive methods. We also compared our results with state-of-the-art methods to determine the effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, we explored color sequences and their impact on the overall quality in background estimation.

## Available tasks

* **Task 1.1**: Gaussian modelling
* **Task 1.2 & 1.3**: Evaluate results
* **Task 2.1**: Recursive Gaussian modelling
* **Task 2.2**: Evaluate and compare to non-recursive
* **Task 3**: Compare with state-of-the-art
* **Task 4**: Colour sequences

## Requirements. 

In order to run the code you will need to clone the repository https://github.com/liruoteng/OpticalFlowToolkit.git to read the optical flow from the Kitty dataset
