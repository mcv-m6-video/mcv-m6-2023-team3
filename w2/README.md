# Week 1

During the first week of our project, our team accomplished several objectives, including becoming proficient with the programming framework, familiarizing ourselves with the relevant databases, and implementing the necessary evaluation metrics and graphs. Additionally, we developed the ability to read and write image sequences and associated segmentation ground truth.

## Available tasks

* **Task 1.1**: IoU & mAP for (ground truth + noise).
* **Task 1.2**: mAP for provided object detections (Mask RCNN, SDD-512, YOLOv3).
* **Task 2**: Temporal analysis (IoU vs time).
* **Task 3**: Optical flow evaluation metrics (MSEN & PEPN).
* **Task 4**: Visual representation optical flow.

## Slides

The slides for w1 are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tblLMqS2rwEGRwNK6NIIsIg-r4ZXQbJeovDwc3PPRDc/edit#slide=id.p).

## Requirements. 

In order to run the code you will need to clone the repository https://github.com/liruoteng/OpticalFlowToolkit.git to read the optical flow from the Kitty dataset
